Basic Analysis Projects


üìö Data Analysis Projects ‚Äì Virtual Internship at Trainity
                This repository contains the projects I completed during my virtual internship at Trainity, where I focused on data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. Each project explores 
   different datasets to draw insights and build business solutions.

üîç Projects Overview
1Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Loan Case Study

  - Objective: Analyze customer data to identify patterns and predict loan approval.
Key Tasks:

  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
    - Analyzing customer demographics and loan status
    - Building a predictive model for loan approval
    - Visualizing insights using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Key Insights:
   
  - Income, credit history, and loan amount significantly affect loan approval.
  -  Customers with stable employment and higher income are more likely to get their loans approved.


2Ô∏è‚É£ IMDB Movie Analysis
    Objective: Analyze IMDB data to identify trends in the film industry and factors affecting movie ratings.
    Key Tasks:
    - Cleaning and analyzing movie data 
    - Understanding trends in genres, budgets, and box office performance
    - Visualizing data to identify correlations between ratings, genres, and release years

   Key Insights:
       - Drama and Comedy are the most common genres.
       - High-budget movies tend to receive better ratings on average.
       - There is a growing trend in action movies in the last decade.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Impact of Car Features on Sales
    Objective: Analyze how car features influence sales and customer preferences.
   Key Tasks:
        - Exploring and cleaning the dataset
        - Identifying the most influential features (price, mileage, engine capacity, etc.)
        - Creating visualizations to summarize the impact of features on car sales
   Key Insights:
       - Mileage and engine power are key factors influencing car sales.
       -  Premium cars with advanced features tend to have a niche but loyal customer base.
       - Mid-range cars dominate the market due to a balance between affordability and features.


üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
       - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
       - Jupyter Notebook
       - Excel for Data Cleaning
       - Power BI for Visualizations
       
üìà Learning Outcomes
    - Improved data cleaning and preprocessing skills
    - Gained experience in analyzing real-world datasets
    - Developed insights through visualizations and statistical analysis
    - Learned how to present data-driven solutions for business problems
